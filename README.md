## About the project

My idea was to develop an application where individuals can effortlessly explore the world of crypto assets. The app provides an unbiased, high-quality, and precise information hub, enabling users to draw their own well-informed conclusions. By making crypto assets easily discoverable, I aimed to democratize access to reliable data and insights for everyone interested in the crypto space.
